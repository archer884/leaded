Web-based fuel expenditure tracking system.

Features:
- Mobile integration (via Twilio)
    - User texts `<gallons> <cost>` and the server stores this information in their account.
    - Responsive site design that looks at least kinda native on both android and ios.
    - Full native on Windows Phone (if I happened to have one).
